# strava-year-recap-but-free

This is against their API TOS

Strava year in review has:
- 2 useless panels
- total days active showing top sports
- total days active (with %)
- fastest activities, longest activities
- how many kudos given and received, local legends segments and segment records
- total elevation and total distance
- top photos of the year
- 2022 totals

## Todo
- ✔️ get Oauth website example
- ✔️ output (basic) data on frontend
- [ ] finish parsing/analytics to get the stats needed
- [ ] find a way to screenshot the data and save as an image
- [ ] figure out hosting and a domain

# Other ideas:
- top 5 kudos buddies (top 5 people who gave you the most kudos)
- some myers-briggs thing with bike archetype or something
- zones data
- when you like to do activities (morning, midday, evening, night)
