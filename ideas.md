# Other ideas:
- top 5 kudos buddies (top 5 people who gave you the most kudos)
- some myers-briggs thing with bike archetype or something
- zones data
- when you like to do activities (morning, midday, evening, night)

group v solo

runner
triathlete
night biker

website or email the result?

## Idea
- don't need to replicate Strava year in review
- one/two panels with adjacent level content is fine

## Strava Archetypes

- Top activity:
- single activity (run, bike, etc.)
- duathelete
- triathlete

- Time of activities: Morning, Noon, Evening, Twilight

- Kudos level doesn't matter

- speed doesn't matter
